# S2D and Cloud Services Onboarding

## About the lab

This lab will help onboarding multiple servers to cloud services (such as Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center and Azure Update Management) at scale as in Windows Admin Center you can onboard your servers only one by one.

You will learn how to download and install Microsoft Monitoring Agent and what steps needs to be done to create new workspace (if needed)

As prerequisite, deploy [S2D hyperconverged scenario](/Scenarios/S2D%20Hyperconverged) just to have some cluster to play with.
