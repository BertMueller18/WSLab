# Introduction to Remote Management

## Lab introduction

*In this lab, you will learn how to use remote management tools to deploy 2 node S2D Cluster. This deployment is simplified, just to illustrate how to perform operations using different remote management tools. It is important, as managing infrastructure at scale requires separate management machine that has access to all machines (Admin Workstation)*

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This lab uses WSLab to create virtual machines that will be used for simulation. Please [Hydrate your lab files](../../../WSLab-Intro/WSLab-Deployment/wslab-deployment.md) first. This lab also uses Windows 10. To hydrate Windows 10 image, you can use CreateParentDisk.ps1 script located in ParentDisks folder.

## LabConfig.ps1

```PowerShell
$LabConfig=@{ DomainAdminName='LabAdmin'; AdminPassword='LS1setup!'; Prefix = 'WSLab-'; SwitchName = 'LabSwitch'; DCEdition='4' ; PullServerDC=$false ; Internet=$true ;AdditionalNetworksConfig=@(); VMs=@(); ServerVHDs=@()}

$LabConfig.VMs += @{ VMName = 'S2D1' ; Configuration = 'S2D' ; ParentVHD = 'Win2019Core_G2.vhdx'; SSDNumber = 0; SSDSize="800GB" ; HDDNumber = 8; HDDSize= 4TB ; MemoryStartupBytes= 2GB ; NestedVirt=$True ; AdditionalNetworks=$true }
$LabConfig.VMs += @{ VMName = 'S2D2' ; Configuration = 'S2D' ; ParentVHD = 'Win2019Core_G2.vhdx'; SSDNumber = 0; SSDSize="800GB" ; HDDNumber = 8; HDDSize= 4TB ; MemoryStartupBytes= 2GB ; NestedVirt=$True ; AdditionalNetworks=$true }
$LabConfig.VMs += @{ VMName = 'Management' ; ParentVHD = 'Win1019H1_G2.vhdx' ; AddToolsVHD=$True ; DisableWCF=$True }
 
$LABConfig.AdditionalNetworksConfig += @{ NetName = 'SMB1'; NetAddress='172.16.1.'; NetVLAN='0'; Subnet='255.255.255.0'}
$LABConfig.AdditionalNetworksConfig += @{ NetName = 'SMB2'; NetAddress='172.16.2.'; NetVLAN='0'; Subnet='255.255.255.0'}
 
```

Above LabConfig will deploy 2 nodes for storage spaces direct, that simulates direct connection between nodes (SMB1,SMB2). It will also deploy Windows 10 machine, that will be used for management. Memory Demand for workshop is ~8GB.

## Task 1: Deploy the lab

*In this task you will deploy lab using aka.ms/wslab. The script will provision vanilla computers that you will configure later in the lab.*

1. Navigate to WSLab folder and edit LabConfig.ps1 with PowerShell ISE (right-click, edit). Replace content with LabConfig code)

1. In WSLab folder you hydrated using [Hydration steps](../../../WSLab-Intro/WSLab-Hydration/wslab-hydration.md), right-click on Deploy.ps1 and select run with PowerShell. Script will run. Allow it to elevate. Deployment will run for ~8 minutes.

1. Once Deployment will finish, open Hyper-V manager. In Hyper-V manager, select all virtual machines and start them.

    >[!TIP] You can also use following PowerShell command to start all VMs:
    >
    >Start-VM -VMName WSLab*

## Task 2: Login to Management VM and install management tools

1. In Hyper-V Manager, right-click on WSLab-Management and select connect.

    >[!TIP] You can also use following PowerShell command open VMConnect and connect to Management VM.
    >
    >vmconnect $env:COMPUTERNAME WSLab-Management


1. In VMConnect, login into Management Machine with following credentials:

    User: **LabAdmin**

    Password: **LS1Setup!**

1. During the login, you will be asked to connect using enhanced session. Confirm it and insert your credentials again. It is important to be connected using Enhanced Session Mode as you will be able to copy/paste code to/from Virtual Machine.
